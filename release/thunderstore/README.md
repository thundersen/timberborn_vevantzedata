## Features

This mod streams data from the game to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) and/or CSV files. This allows the creation of nice graphs as shown above in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) which can be viewed in the browser.

Find setup instructions for InfluxDB and Grafana [here](https://github.com/thundersen/timberborn_vevantzedata/tree/main/doc/INFLUXDB_GRAFANA.md). Follow the instructions to set up preconfigured instances of InfluxDB and Grafana including an example dashboard.

A more detailed description of the mod's features can be found [here](https://github.com/thundersen/timberborn_vevantzedata/tree/main/doc/FEATURES.md).

Currently resource stockpiles and population counts are captured, but much more will follow in the...

## Future

- Moar data. Power production/consumption, water levels, wind speed, FPS, ... anything goes. Feel free to submit suggestions.
- In-game alerts. Define your own alerts and receive a notification in game.
- Support for IRL alerts. Define alerts and hook up smart home devices, get a text message or what have you. Note that this is already possible for those that know how to set it up with InfluxDB! Examples and guides will follow in the future. 
- Integration with other mods to allow them to use ze data as well, e.g., for showing graphs in-game, using alerts to automate buildings, ...
